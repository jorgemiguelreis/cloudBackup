Getting started with the Dropbox Android SDK:
1. Include everything under lib/ in your project/build.
2. You'll want to start off by creating an AndroidAuthSession with your
   consumer key and secret.
3. Create a DropboxAPI object with your session.
4. Start developing the rest of your Dropbox API Android app!
